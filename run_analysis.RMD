This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. This Notebook has been supplied as an easy way to walk through the steps of my code in chunks, with longer explanations than the R script has. The R script is also located in this repo.

Load libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
```

Bring in label tables for activity and feature. These are used to join with the data tables to create column names 
```{r}
#bring in activity labels. These will be used to join names with the type of activity
act_labs<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
#bring in the feature labels. These will used to join names with the data types
feature<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
```

Bring in the test data. This is the data, subject, and labels for the subjects that were under the "test" category.
```{r}
test=read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
#bring in subject test table
test_sub<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
#bring in the test labels. These will be used to join activity type to the results in the test table
test_labs<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt")
```

Bring in the train data. This is the data, subject, and labels for the subjects that were under the "train" category.
```{r}
#bring in the train labels. These will be used to join activity type to the results in the train table
train_labs=read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt")
#bring in the train data
train=read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
#bring in subject traintable
train_sub<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
```

Merge all of the test tables together
        - Gets all of the relevant data and column names into one table 
        - Notice that the names of my data frames are explicit - (satisfies assignment criteria 3 & 4)
                test_labs = test labels
                test = test data
                feature_list = feature list
                activity = activity
                datatpe = data type
```{r}
#merge test data with activity label table & rename column to explicit name (activity = V2)
test_labs2<-merge(test_labs, act_labs) %>% select(activity = V2)
#ensure the tables we want to merge next have the same number of rows
nrow(test) == nrow(test_labs2) #they do!
#bind with test label table
test2<-cbind(test_labs2, test)
#bind with test subject data
test3<-cbind(test2, test_sub)
#create list of features to add as column names in test dataframe
feature_list<-c("activity", feature$V2, "subject")
#rename the columns
colnames(test3)<-feature_list
#create new column that says this is test data
test3$datatype<-"test"
```

Merge all of the train tables together
        - Gets all of the relevant data and column names into one table 
        - Notice that the names of my data frames are explicit - (satisfies assignment criteria 3 & 4)
                train_labs = train labels
                train = train data
                feature_list = feature list
                activity = activity
                datatpe = data type
                subject = subject
```{r}
#merge train data with activity label table & rename column to explicit name (activity = V2)
train_labs2<-merge(train_labs, act_labs) %>% select(activity = V2)
#ensure the tables we want to merge next have the same number of rows
nrow(train) == nrow(train_labs2) #they do!
#bind with train label table
train2<-cbind(train_labs2, train)
#bind with subject data
train3<-cbind(train2, train_sub)
#create list of features to add as column names in train dataframe
feature_list<-c("activity", feature$V2,"subject")
#rename the columns
colnames(train3)<-feature_list
#create new column that says this is train data
train3$datatype<-"train"
```

Bind the training and test sets to create one data set.
        - (This satisfies assignment criteria 1.)
```{r}
#ensure the tables we want to merge next have the same number of columns
ncol(test3) == ncol(train3) #they do!
#bind train and test data together
data_all<-rbind(test3, train3)
```

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        - (This satisfies assignment criteria 2.)
```{r}
#use regex to extract the columns that have mean in the variable name and create new dataframe
mean<-data_all[grep("[Mm]ean|activity|datatype|subject", names(data_all))]
#use regex to extract the columns that have std in the variable name and create new dataframe
std<- data_all[grep("[Ss]td|activity|datatype|subject", names(data_all))]
#bind the two datasets together to create one dataset that only has the means and std
data2<-cbind(mean, std)
```

Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the data set in step 4.
        - (This satisfies assignment criteria 5.)
```{r}
#create a list of column names from the dataset in step 4
cols=colnames(data2)
#filter the ones that are not variables
cols=cols[-c(1,55:57,91:92)]
#turn data2 into a data table rather than a data frame
data2<-data.table(data2)
#make the data long rather than wide using the cols list we created to name the variable columns
data3<-melt(data2, id.vars = c("subject", "datatype", "activity"), measure.vars=cols)
#ensure the subject column is in character form rather than numeric to keep R from treating it as a number
data3$subject<-as.character(data3$subject)
#create new data table from the tidy long format above
data4=data3
#calculate the mean of each variable by subject and activity using data.table
data4=data4[ , .(mean(value)),by=.(subject, activity, variable)]
#rename the average column with a desccriptive name
data4=rename(data4,average=V1)
```

Write data table to a CSV
```{r}
write.csv(data4, "Week4_run_analysis_assignment_FINAL.csv")
```
